        <p id="main">
          In Great Philadelphia Region, there are a variety of opportunities to create a connected network of
          multi-use trails. Some of them are long-existing railway and some are parts of grennway corridors
          alongside the region's creek buffering and park systems. A number of significant trail segments already
          exist or under construction, but there are still gaps between segments.<br><br>
          In May 2012, efforts in the Philadelphia Mayor Office were made to fill the gaps and connected the network
          of these multi-use trails called The Circuits, working with foundations, governments, non-profit organizations,
          economic development professionals and many other groups. These efforts are valuable in improving the accessibility
          and promoting multi-use transportation systems on the regional level of the Great Philadelphia.
